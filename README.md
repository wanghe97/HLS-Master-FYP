# HLS-Master-FYP
This is my MSc FYP.  

It explored the effect of compiler optimizations on area and speed of HLS-generated hardware.  

The benchmark used is Polybench, which is provided in polybench-syn.  

It uses two academic HLS tools: Bambu and Vericert.  

The shell script for Bambu is named bambu15.sh, and the shell script for Vericert is named vericert2.sh. 

The main program is written in C language. merit2.c contains the code for Bambu, and vmerit2.c contains the code for Vericert.

# HLS-Master-FYP
This is my MSc FYP.  

It explored the effect of compiler optimizations on area and speed of HLS-generated hardware.  

The benchmark used is Polybench, which is provided in **[benchmarks/polybench-syn](https://github.com/ymherklotz/vericert.git)**.  

It uses two academic HLS tools: [Bambu](https://github.com/ferrandi/PandA-bambu.git) and [Vericert](https://github.com/ymherklotz/vericert.git).  

The shell script for Bambu is named '**bambu15.sh**', and the shell script for Vericert is named '**vericert2.sh**'. 

The main program is written in C language. '**merit2.c**' contains the code for Bambu, and '**vmerit2.c**' contains the code for Vericert.
